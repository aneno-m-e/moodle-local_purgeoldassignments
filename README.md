## What is this?
This plugin allows a site manager to delete historical files stored within an assignment - at 1/2/3 year intervals. Note: it deletes the files but does not remove grades etc.

3 standard file areas are currently supported
* assignfeedback_editpdf
* assignfeedback_file
* assignsubmission_file

This was developed for a specific use-case and there is room for improvement - pull requests are always welcome.
